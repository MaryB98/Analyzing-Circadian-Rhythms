This project analyzes global online activity patterns by examining timestamped social media data tied to different professional roles and geographic locations. The primary objective is to uncover behavioral trends, particularly circadian rhythms—across occupations and regions based on when and where users are most active.

The dataset includes anonymized user IDs, occupations, timestamps, and locations. Initial data preprocessing involved removing missing values, duplicates, special characters, and filtering for relevant cities and countries to ensure high-quality analysis.

#Libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy for numerical operations
Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn for data visualization Plotly 

#Key insights and tasks completed:

Occupation vs. Activity: Identified which roles are most represented in the dataset. Founders and directors emerged as the most active groups.

Location Analysis: London was identified as the most frequent location, with high activity observed across multiple global cities.

Hourly Activity Trends: Analyzed distribution of posts by hour, revealing peak engagement between 9 AM and 8 PM across most locations.

Monthly Activity: Focused on data from 2020, showing increased activity between March and June.

User Engagement Classification: Labeled users as “Frequent” or “Infrequent” based on their post count threshold, helping distinguish between occasional and high-volume users.

Visualizations such as bar plots, word clouds, treemaps, and pie charts were used to illustrate trends in occupation, location, and time-based behavior.

This analysis can support research in behavioral science, digital marketing, and time-based engagement strategies by helping to understand when and where users are most active online.
